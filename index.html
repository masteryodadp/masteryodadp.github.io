            <h1>Welcome to the users!</h1>
            <p>Hello dear visitors of my portfolio. In it you can learn about my skills and evaluate their level. This code was written by me with the help of the program JetBrains PHPStorm 2018. The basis of the site site is HTML & CSS code.</p>
            <p>I studied on my own using courses, as I am quite interested in doing this. At the end of the course I was faced with a problem, which is that on many freelancing sites, the customer requires cases (portfolio) of my work. Since I am an aspiring freelancer, I cannot get through the competition of artists who have been sitting for years on such sites.</p>
            <p>To your attention is invited to the "Menu of the Site" in which you can find all the answers to your questions. I create a separate page for each skill that I have acquired. I hope for long-term cooperation.</p>
            <h2>Lets start.</h2>
            <p>P.S. I also attached my contacts to connect with me.</p>
